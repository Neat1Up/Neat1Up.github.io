## About Me

Hi, I'm Blessing, a student interested in programming.  
This project was part of my final quest in my Computer Programming high school class, and it reflects what I’ve learned about Python and coding in general.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *The Game of Games*   
**One-line pitch:** A game where you have to click on red and blue balls that fly at random intervals around the screen. There are opportunities to get extra lives by collecting coins in the game and using those coins in the Bonus Game slot machine.
