## About Me

Hi, I'm [Your First Name], a student interested in programming.  
This project was part of my final quest in my Computer Programming high school class, and it reflects what I’ve learned about Python and coding in general.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *Bonus Game Slot Machine*   
**One-line pitch:** A slot machine game that behaves very similarly to the bonus game from Super Mario Bros. 2, with a similar GUI and similar objects.
