Pygame MUST be installed for this to work!

Instructions:
1. Download all files except for the README.
2. Open up a code editor (or download one if you don't already have one (Sublime Text, VS Code, etc.))
3. Open the hello.py file and run it. (Make sure all the game files are in the same folder.)
4. Enjoy!
