### Project Focus

[What kind of project are you planning to build? Give it a working title and briefly describe what it is (e.g., a game, simulation, interactive story). What makes it interesting or challenging?]

I want to make a Bonus Game Slot Machine that acts like the Bonus Game in Super Mario Bros. 2. It'll have three options, and if you get the same object for all three options that's not a cherry, your score will increase by 1. If you get a cherry for the first option, your score will increase by 1. If you get a cherry for the first two, your score will increase by 2. And if you get a cherry for all three, your score will increase by 5.

### Why This Project 

[What drew you to this idea? How does it connect to something you’re interested in—whether in or outside of class? Why is this the right project for *you* to work on right *now*?]

I think this project will help me to experiment a little more with while loops in Python, and also to learn about something new, like how to use Python to manipulate GUIs to work and register input. I think this will be a nice challenge to force myself to use Python instead of other coding languages that I'm familiar with to achieve a certain result that I want to achieve.

### What I Want to Learn

[What programming concepts do you want to strengthen through this project (e.g., functions, conditionals, loops, data structures)?  
Beyond coding, what personal or creative skills are you hoping to build—like debugging, problem solving, design, or perseverance?]

I want to practice using while loops more, because I think those are the kinds of loops that I've had the most trouble using/mastering. And I also want to learn to practice patience with my code and whenever something doesn't go the way I want it to go.

### My Approach 

[How do you plan to structure your time over the next two weeks? What will you focus on first? What will you prioritize later?  
What does “done enough” look like to you—and how will you decide when to stop polishing?]

(Day 1 - Setting/Starting the Program Up/Start Designing GUIs)
(Day 2 - Continue Designing GUIs and Visuals/Objects in Bonus Game)
(Day 3 - Coding the Game (The Looping))
(Day 4 - Coding the Game pt 2 (Item Selection))
(Day 5 - Coding the Game pt 3 (Item Selection Award System))

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]

I want to get Pygame to work, because I haven't yet figured out how to use it, or how to get it to work.
